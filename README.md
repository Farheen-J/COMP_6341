# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

To create a face keypoint detection system, this research integrates the understanding of computer vision techniques with deep learning architectures. Numerous applications use facial keypoints, which are points on the face around the eyes, mouth, and nose. Facial tracking, facial position recognition, facial filters, and emotion identification are some of these uses. Any image may be analysed by the algorithm, which can then identify faces and forecast the positions of keypoints on each face.
